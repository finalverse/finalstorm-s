#  MeshSystem

This sophisticated mesh system provides:

1. Intelligent Caching - Prevents loading the same mesh multiple times
2. Multiple Format Support - USDZ, USD, OBJ with fallbacks
3. Procedural Generation - Creates meshes when files aren't available
4. Async Loading - Non-blocking mesh loading with proper task management
5. Error Handling - Graceful fallbacks when loading fails
6. Avatar Mesh Factory - Generates avatar meshes based on appearance
7. Terrain Mesh Factory - Creates terrain from heightmaps
8. OBJ Parser - Custom parser for OBJ files

This follows modern game engine patterns and provides the foundation for a sophisticated 3D asset pipeline.
